Light is one of the most important things in the life of most living beings. Because of this, it is common to work with light sensors when learning about electronics. The simple light sensor features a light-dependent resistor (LDR) and a sensor on a small breakout board for easier connection. As the name suggests, the LDR will change its resistance depending on the amount of light it’s exposed to. The amount of light and resistance are inversely proportional. The more light it’s exposed to, the less resistance it will have. Thus, if there’s more light, the board will have a resistance of a few hundred Ohms. If the resistor is in the dark, it will have a resistance of several thousand Ohms.




The main benefit of this board is ability to give analog and digital output. By setting the potenciometer on the board, you are able to get digital signal at the DO pin when signal crosses certain value, while analog values will be present on the AO pin at all times.

## Repository contents

All Soldered Electronics hardware designed in KiCAD, and repositories are organized in the following way:

- CAD folder - contains KiCAD files (Schematics, Board, Panel Board), sorted by version. Change log lists all changes between versions.
- OUTPUTS - contains useful files, such as Bill of Materials (BOM), PDF of schematics, 3D .step file of the board and gerber files, sorted by version. 
- OUTPUTS -> Compliance - Certificates and useful legal stuff.
